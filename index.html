        HTML/CSS Authoring Exercise

        <p>Please make this Word document into HTML and style it with CSS. 
        You can ‚Äúhand this in‚Äù as a link to <a href="https://codepen.io/"> CodePen</a>, 
        <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>, or whatever 
        you like. Just send an email with any links/‚Äãnotes/‚Äãattachments to

        <p><b>You can even skip this altogether</b> if you have an existing project where:
        <!-- The dashed list was harder than I would like to admit, definitely had to look
        it up.  It's cool about the 'li:before' styling that style-typed the bullet as 'none'
        and actually puts the emdash as 'content' in there, I didn't know you could do that. -->
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li> You wrote some HTML/CSS yourself </li>
                <li> It demonstrates <i>your</i> sensibilities</li>
                <li> You can share what requirements drove the project</li>
            </ul>

            There's not a "right answer" for this exercise. It‚Äôs a task that has some 
            similarities to things you‚Äôd be asked to do in the position you‚Äôre applying 
            for. We‚Äôre interested in the approach you take and any decisions  you make 
            along the way. We‚Äôre also fully aware that Word does not lend itself to making 
            clean, compliant web content, and we‚Äôd like to know you have the attention 
            to detail that is required to separate (the author‚Äôs) signal from (the software‚Äôs) noise.
        </p>

        <p class="darker-blue">
            In the course of our actual work together, you‚Äôd be free and encouraged to ask questions 
            about anything uncertain‚Äîfor this exercise, however, we want to provide the same information 
            to all applicants and get a sense of what decisions you will make on your own. We‚Äôre not 
            looking for fancy coding here, we just want to make sure you understand the structures and 
            syntaxes of HTML/CSS, as well as how the two work together.

        <!-- Just copy and pasted the emoji and it showed up correctly. If it hadn't I'm 
        pretty sure I could find an HTML &# char for it. Curious on if that shows up in all 
        browsers as is. -->
        <p>
            We recognize the effort it takes to apply for a position even without an exercise like this one, 
            especially in the likely reality that you are applying for multiple positions at this time‚Ä¶ which 
            is sort of like working for free üò¨. Our hope for this project is that it ultimately saves time 
            for all involved and gives everyone a fair chance to show what they can do without necessarily 
            having a similar project in their past that they can point to and recontextualize.

                        thinking as you go is appreciated. What did you notice? What 
                        issues did you have and what ambiguities did you encounter? Did 
                        you resolve all of these?

        with all the weird styling in the original you wanted to see if I could re-create it as close
